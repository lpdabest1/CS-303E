"Captain's log entry 253: Our ship is still on course to enter pluto's atmosphere in approximately 56 hours. We've finished
preparations for the landing and subsequent sciencing that is to be done once we reach the planet, all that's left now is to
wait for the ship to breach the atmosphere, so I've instructed the crew to get as much sleep as they can in the next 53 hours,
because after that, the crew will be very busy.
Captain Danvers, signing off."
